a.) 
Global namespace scope - define objects, functions, types, and templates in the outermost namespace scope of a program. If an identifier's declaration is outside of any and all blocks, namespaces, and classes, then the identifier has global namespace scope.
Example
int main(){
int n = 99;}
b.)
Local scope - a quality of variables that confers a local context on their values.
example;
int marks()
maark 1 = 99;}
c.
Function prototype scope - reaches its conclusion at the point where the closest enclosing function declarator finishes.
example;
int main()
{
.........
greet()..
d.
Funtion scope - It can be seen anywhere within the body of a function, even before the point where the function is declared. The availability of function scope enables the writing of statements such as "goto cleaning" before the actual cleanup.
